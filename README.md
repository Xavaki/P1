### Practice 1 
- unless otherwise indicated, all python functions have been coded from scratch.
- All dependencies inside requirements.txt

##### Exercise 1
Inside script rgb_yuv.py. Receives as arguments:
- Transformation: rgb2yuv *or* yuv2rgb
- Vector: abc *or* a,b,c \
*Call it from terminal as: python rgb_yuv.py rgb2yuv/yuv2rgb abc/a,b,c*

##### Exercise 2, 3
Output images inside directory output_images.
Screenshots inside directory screenshots.

##### Exercise 4
Inside script run_length.py. Receives as arguments:
- n: length of (randomly generated) sequence to encode. \
*Call it from terminal as: python run_length.py n* 

##### Exercise 5
Inside script jpeg_codec.py (I tried to implement a full mock codec but I ran out of time). Takes as arguments: 
- Filename: name of the image to encode (script will save encoded data in a .txt file in the same directory) \
*Call it from terminal as: python jpeg_codec.py filename* \
*Try it with blade_runner.png !*
